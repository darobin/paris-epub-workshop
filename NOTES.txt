Don't Judge A Book By Its Markup

- explain how HTML is achieving XML's goal
- show the simple identity XSLT transform that converts XHTML to HTML
- examples of issues:
    - jQuery problem, important for interactive content, lack of testing
    - convergence with namespacing issues
- can keep XML workflow, just output HTML
- full convergence with the web
- the important part here is the client, not the generation process
- even polyglot can work so long as the client is interpreting the content as HTML

- there is however a need to plan for the future and effect changes accordingly
