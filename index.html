        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          XML was initially designed as “SGML for the Web”. While there is no doubt that this was
          a highly meritorious vision, it is a rather simple fact that — at least where client-side
          Web technology is concerned — it has failed to come into existence. Furthermore, that
          fact is not about to change. On the contrary, the entire client-side stack of Web
          technology has moved away from XML almost entirely, and will continue to do so for the
          foreseeable future.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can at first seem unsettling, if not downright worrying, for those who have invested
          in XML, often primarily on the server side. There is also often a perception that the
          promises of interoperability made by XML will be exterminated in an HTML world, supposed
          to be unprocessable, messy “tag soup”.
        </p>
        <p>
          So are we doomed? Must we throw all that XML brought to the table out through the window?
          Are we condemned to a choice between managing a chaotic format or cloistering ourselves up
          in a small irredentist community of XML increasingly detached from the world? This paper's
          position on each of these questions is a resounding “No”. It is, however, necessary to
          understand where the technological landscape is headed, and accordingly to make course
          corrections in some aspects.

        <h2>Nothing is Lost</h2>
        <p>
          First of all, the vision of full interoperability and distributed extensibility remains.
          In fact, it is stronger than it has ever been. It is coming to fruition, albeit not in the
          way initially envisioned by the XML project.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML is no longer a “tag soup” language. Following a Herculean effort, its parsing has
          now been fully defined, in a manner that remains compatible with the vast amounts of 
          existing content. The level of interoperability between implementations is extremely
          high, and their performance is overall excellent. The one lesser spot (that is being
          addressed) is that HTML parsers for server-side languages are still lagging. But as we
          will see below, that is not a cause of concern for the topic that occupies us here.
        </p>
        <p>
          XML had grand plans for distributed extensibility built atop namespaces, that were 
          expected to enable compound document formats, distributed discoverable implementation, and
          semantic safety, but for the most part this system barely evolved beyond the syntax
          level and never reached the hard problems of integrating distributed behaviour. Even for
          relatively simple aspects such as validation, existing XML solutions are poorly equipped
          to face distributed extensibility; the only viable solution is NVDL and very few people
          ever use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, HTML is tackling precisely such difficult issues through the ongoing
          work on Web Components. While it is still too early to call it a success, the first
          implementations are promising, there is a lot of momentum behind this approach, and it
          certainly is offering solutions to these hard problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          My point here is not to belittle XML or to argue for its dismissal across the board in
          favour of HTML. Rather, I believe that as a community we need to align our expectations
          on reality in order to better plan for the future through the technologies that we 
          develop.
        </p>
        <p>
          XML has been and remains a very strong solution to capture and process disparate
          information with variegated structure, and is particularly good at encoding textual
          content. It benefits from a solid ecosystem of tried and true tools that often surpass
          those available to other systems. On the client, however, we need to agree that it is
          quite simply dead. HTML on the other hand now provides for an extremely powerful
          client-side platform that is unrivalled in its power and richness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on such updated expectations about each technology, I believe that it is clear
          that the two are complementary, and that publishers who are already heavily invested in
          the XML tool chain can greatly benefit from the alliance of both.
