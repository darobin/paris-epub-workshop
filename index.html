        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          This is a personal attempt at organising my thoughts about the way the universe as a whole
          works. Not only is the goal of this unlikely project of unreasonable ambition, but this
          work is very far from complete. What is to be found here is speculation on intuitions,
          jotted down hastily. Reading this document is not particularly recommended.

          But hey, I'm having fun.

          - disembodied computation is just another mathematical tool, not immediately better
          - layered computers with properties that influence what runs on them though is an
            interesting idea
