        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          XML was initially designed as “SGML for the Web”. While there is no doubt that this was
          a highly meritorious vision, it is a rather simple fact that — at least where client-side
          Web technology is concerned — it has failed to come into existence. Furthermore, that
          fact is not about to change. On the contrary, the entire client-side stack of Web
          technology has moved away from XML almost entirely, and will continue to do so for the
          foreseeable future.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can at first seem unsettling, if not downright worrying, for those who have invested
          in XML, often primarily on the server side. There is also often a perception that the
          promises of interoperability made by XML will be exterminated in an HTML world, supposed
          to be unprocessable, messy “tag soup”.
        </p>
        <p>
          So are we doomed? Must we throw all that XML brought to the table out through the window?
          Are we condemned to a choice between managing a chaotic format or cloistering ourselves up
          in a small irredentist community of XML increasingly detached from the world? This paper's
          position on each of these questions is a resounding “No”. It is, however, necessary to
          understand where the technological landscape is headed, and accordingly to make course
          corrections in some aspects.

        <h2>Nothing is Lost</h2>
        <p>
          First of all, the vision of full interoperability and distributed extensibility remains.
          In fact, it is stronger than it has ever been. It is coming to fruition, albeit not in the
          way initially envisioned by the XML project.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML is no longer a “tag soup” language. Following a Herculean effort, its parsing has
          now been fully defined, in a manner that remains compatible with the vast amounts of 
          existing content. The level of interoperability between implementations is extremely
          high, and their performance is overall excellent. The one lesser spot (that is being
          addressed) is that HTML parsers for server-side languages are still lagging. But as we
          will see below, that is not a cause of concern for the topic that occupies us here.
        </p>
        <p>
          XML had grand plans for distributed extensibility built atop namespaces, that were 
          expected to enable compound document formats, distributed discoverable implementation, and
          semantic safety, but for the most part this system barely evolved beyond the syntax
          level and never reached the hard problems of integrating distributed behaviour. Even for
          relatively simple aspects such as validation, existing XML solutions are poorly equipped
          to face distributed extensibility; the only viable solution is NVDL and very few people
          ever use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the meantime, HTML is tackling precisely such difficult issues through the ongoing
          work on Web Components. While it is still too early to call it a success, the first
          implementations are promising, there is a lot of momentum behind this approach, and it
          certainly is offering solutions to these hard problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          My point here is not to belittle XML or to argue for its dismissal across the board in
          favour of HTML. Rather, I believe that as a community we need to align our expectations
          on reality in order to better plan for the future through the technologies that we 
          develop.
        </p>
        <p>
          XML has been and remains a very strong solution to capture and process disparate
          information with variegated structure, and is particularly good at encoding textual
          content. It benefits from a solid ecosystem of tried and true tools that often surpass
          those available to other systems. On the client, however, we need to agree that it is
          quite simply dead. HTML on the other hand now provides for an extremely powerful
          client-side platform that is unrivalled in its power and richness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on such updated expectations about each technology, I believe that it is clear
          that the two are complementary, and that publishers who are already heavily invested in
          the XML tool chain can greatly benefit from the alliance of both.

        <h2>Harmony</h2>
        <p>
          The prospect of deploying two technologies instead of one may at first seem daunting.
          Will it not incur greater complexity? We will look at why HTML is in fact a simplification
          over XHTML in the next section, but first consider the following piece of code:
        </p>
        <pre>
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
                xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">
  &lt;xsl:output method="html" 
              doctype-system="about:legacy-compat" encoding="UTF-8"/>
  &lt;xsl:template match="@*|node()">
    &lt;xsl:copy>
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="@*|node()"/>
    &lt;/xsl:copy>
  &lt;/xsl:template>
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet>
        </pre>
        <p>
          If you have an existing pipeline that is already producing XHTML, tacking this simple
          XSLT 1.0 style sheet at its end is <em>all</em> you need in order to switch you production
          processing to HTML. There is nothing complicated about it, it ought to execute rather
          quickly in most modern processors, and of course instead of an extra step you can simply
          modify the <code>xsl:output</code> of a preceding sheet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The amount of work required in order to evolve the XML production pipeline is therefore
          as minimal as it gets. Keep the XML, just output HTML.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Don't Judge A Book By Its Markup</h2>
        <p>
          At this point the astute reader might ask: “Wait a second… why not just use XHTML then?”
        </p>
        <p>
          There are two primary reasons. First, XHTML is not simply “HTML in XML”. There are
          differences in the way in which it gets processed in the browser, and while efforts have
          been made to keep the delta to a minimum, it is still there, and there is no doubt that
          if you ever author XHTML with the expectation that it will behave exactly like HTML, that
          delta will come back to bite you in the debugger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Second, it is important to understand that developers of tools and libraries created for
          Web content rarely, if ever, test for XHTML. A lot of the time, they also don't care about
          XHTML-related issues when they are reported.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can quickly become a problem when for instance interactivity is added to content
          through the use of JavaScript libraries. A good example is jQuery, which can at times work
          fine in XHTML mode and then all of a sudden blow up in an inexplicable (and hard to debug)
          fashion at an innocuous-looking line of code that seems no different from the ones around
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is the reason why using HTML on the client side reduces complexity compared to using
          XHTML. XHTML is used on the client so rarely that whenever you do anything ever-so-slightly
          out of the ordinary the odds are good that you are the first one to do it. And the only
          thing that comes from exploring such obscure code paths is not the glory of discovery but
          solely the pain of booby-trapped corridors. Readers already suffer from enough
          interoperability issues on their own; there is no need to make the problem worse with
          XHTML.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem also applies in reverse. Solutions designed to work with XHTML, for instance
          ones that make use of namespaces, will not port well to HTML. This effectively locks
          ebook content off the Web and prevents its natural evolution into an integrated Web in 
          which one seamlessly navigates from page to book to app. This also means that the broader
          Web community is not taking part in solutions designed for what then becomes the ebook
          silo, which in turn deprives them of a vast reservoir of support and innovation.
        </p>
        <p style='font-size: 0.8em; font-variant: italic'>
          Note that when I discuss XHTML in this paper, I mean <strong>real</strong> XHTML, which is
          to say served as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> and processed using an XML parser.
          That is different from using polyglot markup, which may be using XHTML syntax but is
          processed by browsers as if it were HTML, thereby leading to no differences whatsoever.
          Polyglot can be somewhat useful in some specific situations, but it should not be
          prescribed as a silver bullet.
