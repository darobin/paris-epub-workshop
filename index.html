        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          XML was initially designed as “SGML for the Web”. While there is no doubt that this was
          a highly meritorious vision, it is a rather simple fact that — at least where client-side
          Web technology is concerned — it has failed to come into existence. Furthermore, that
          fact is not about to change. On the contrary, the entire client-side stack of Web
          technology has moved away from XML almost entirely, and will continue to do so for the
          foreseeable future.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can at first seem unsettling, if not downright worrying, for those who have invested
          in XML, often primarily on the server side. There is also often a perception that the
          promises of interoperability made by XML will be exterminated in an HTML world, supposed
          to be unprocessable, messy “tag soup”.
        </p>
        <p>
          So are we doomed? Must we throw all that XML brought to the table out through the window?
          Are we condemned to a choice between managing a chaotic format or cloistering ourselves up
          in a small irredentist community of XML increasingly detached from the world? This paper's
          position on each of these questions is a resounding “No”. It is, however, necessary to
          understand where the technological landscape is headed, and accordingly to make course
          corrections in some aspects.

        <h2>Nothing is Lost</h2>
        <!--
          - the vision remains
          - it is in fact coming to fruition, though not in the expected manner
          - very strong interoperability (and performance) in HTML parsing
          - (server-side implementations lagging)
          - update your expectations
        -->

        <h2>Harmony</h2>
        <!--
          - show the simple identity XSLT transform that converts XHTML to HTML
          - can keep XML workflow, just output HTML
        -->

        <h2>Don't Judge A Book By Its Markup</h2>
        <!--
          - problems with XHTML on the client
          - jQuery problem, important for interactive content, lack of testing
          - convergence with namespacing issues

        <h2>Client of the Future</h2>
        <!--
          - the important part here is the client, not the generation process
          - fully HTML based
          - full convergence with the Web
          - (even polyglot can work so long as the client is interpreting the content as HTML)
